- Vercel: https://10-murex.vercel.app/
## âœ¨ Features

- Create and delete notes with a beautiful interface
- Responsive design that works seamlessly on all devices
- Real-time updates using React state management
- Modern and clean user interface inspired by Google Keep
- Fast and efficient performance
- PWA (Progressive Web App) capabilities

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: React.js 18
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for modern, utility-first styling
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState)
- **Build Tool**: Create React App
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Deployment**: Netlify & Vercel

## ðŸ—‚ Project Structure

```
src/
  components/
    Header.jsx       # App header component with Keeper branding
    Note.jsx        # Individual note component with delete functionality
    CreateNote.jsx  # Note creation form with title and content inputs
  App.js           # Main application component with state management
  index.js         # Application entry point with React 18 features
  index.css        # Global styles and Tailwind directives
```

## ðŸ’­ Technical Challenges & Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Setting up Tailwind CSS with Create React App
   - **Solution**: Installed required dependencies (tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer) and configured tailwind.config.js correctly

2. **Challenge**: Making the layout responsive
   - **Solution**: Utilized Tailwind's responsive classes (md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3) for different screen sizes

3. **Challenge**: Implementing smooth animations
   - **Solution**: Used Tailwind's transition utilities for hover and click effects

4. **Challenge**: Managing note state effectively
   - **Solution**: Implemented React's useState hook for centralized state management

## ðŸš€ Performance Optimizations

1. Used React.memo for optimizing re-renders
2. Implemented efficient state updates
3. Utilized Tailwind's JIT compiler for smaller CSS bundles
4. Added PWA capabilities for offline access

## ðŸ›  Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jeeltech6/10.git
   cd 10/keeper-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
